  <title>My Opinion on the Colors</title>

  <h1 class="title">What is the Best Color? ðŸ¤”</h1>

    <h2 id="red">RED</h2>
    <p> Let's start off with red. Red is passionate, fiery, and hot. I see the color as a him. VERY AGGRESSIVE. He'd totally be that one person in high school that you wouldn't mess with because you're too scared of what he'd do. Red is also on
      basically every fast food logo and snack because it makes us hungry. It really do be making us eat, so I like red because of that.</p>



    <h2 id="orange">ORANGE</h2>
    <p> Orange is weird because I hate the neon version, but the sunset and creamsicle versions are great. I used to hate it more because it was just a weird color to me, but then I learned to appreciate it because orange (depending on its brightness
      and saturation) make all the skin tones, so it's pretty important. I think i'll call orange a he as well. He's the guy you don't have a problem with, probably don't notice him on your sports team, but he builds the foundation of it. </p>

    <h2 id="yellow">YELLOW</h2>
    <p> Yellow is the most supreme color and here is why. First, it's the color of the sun (at least when we draw one). The sun provides life on Earth, YELLOW IS THE REASON YOU'RE ALIVE. It also makes people happy just by looking at it, isn't that a
      great power especially in our current world? Yellow also has the phrase "ello" so it's like saying hi to you. How nice! Or you could say it has "Yell," so it's trying to get you to yell out your feelings so you feel better. Overall, a great
      color. Definitely the nicest girl who owns a sunflower farm if Yellow was a person. </p>

    <h2 id="green">GREEN</h2>
    <p>I used to hate green because all I saw was neon green on the graphic tees I'd wear that my mom bought for me. But lately, seeing varients like cyan and evergreen have really made me appreciate the color. Green is also important because
      chlorophyll is green, and without plants we'd be dead. So appreciate it, just maybe not the neon version. I don't think green has a gender either, dunno why. But I'd say they love gaming, going on long walks through forests, and amazing at
      every subject. </p>

    <h2 id="blue">BLUE</h2>
    <p> BASIC- I'm sorry but no one hates this color. It's said that a lot of people like it because blue is calming, and because the sky is blue and it's what we usually see first as a baby (even though it's more of a cyan but whatever). Blue can be
      sad, or serene. It can even be nostalgic like baby blue, pristine like royal blue, or classic like navy blue. But because blue is so prevalent, I find it hard to praise it. Nevertheless, blue is an essential color to us. I'd say blue is a boy
      (wow we love gender stereotypes)</p>

    <h2 id="purple">PURPLE</h2>
    <p>Purple is like the AP class of colors; it's A D V A N C E D. We all associate it with royalty, but for some reason it's not appreciated enough in my opinion. in eyeshadow, it's the hardest color to make pigmented. In painting, it's difficult to get that rich purple (at least in my experience), but when you eventually get it, the color always brings a certain poise to whatever you're using it for. To me, purple is a female that doesn't talk in school often, but you see the amazing life they're living outside of class. </p>
