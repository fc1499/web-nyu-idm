  <h1> My <3 Tattoo</h1>

      <button id="first">06.02.16</button>

      <p id="text1">This is my old high school where I thought of the phrase "everything is less than 3." When I had to say goodbye to my math teacher/friend/coach, I wrote in a letter, "if there's anything I learned in your class, it's that
        everything is <3." </p>

      <button id="second">06.28.16</button>
      <!-- this was when I began moving from SC to NJ. During the road trip, I was upset at the thought of losing my old friends and having to go to a new school/city. but turning the phrase into my mantra helped ease the negativity. -->
      <button id="third">08.10.16</button>
<!-- I realized I loved the phrase so much that I would start saying it at the end of every video I made. Making YouTube videos became my main hobby as I did not have friends besides the ones back home. -->
      <button id="fourth">05.17.18</button>
<!-- as the community on my channel grew, so did the amount of people who stood by the phrase. I made sure all of them knew what the <3 symbol meant to me, because I wanted to spread a positive message whenever they watched. -->
      <button id="fifth">02.14.19</button>
<!-- 100,000 subscribers! And with that came a merch deal. I was able to partner with a company and design my own clothes for people to buy. Of course, the first thing I designed had the phrase "everything is <3" on it. -->
      <button id="sixth">12.30.19</button>
<!-- After realizing how much the <3 has influenced me and many others, I wanted to make sure I'd never forget it. The only thing left that would make it permanent would be a tattoo. -->
