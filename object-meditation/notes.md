# Object Meditation: My <3 Tattoo

### What are 5 words that come to mind when I think of this object?
- pain
- love
- forever
- alive
- math

### Are there spacial places this object is associated with?
- Besides the building I got the tattoo in, I get reminded of my old high school, specifically the room my math class was in.

### What does my object look like?
- it looks like a heart, except how we used to type one pre-emoji. <3

### Feel like?
- it feels like my wrist, except right now it is still a little bumpy because I just got it a month ago.

### Sound like?
- doesn't make a sound, except what the slap of a wrist would sound like.

### Smell like?
- skin.

### Where did you get it?
- Think Ink in Moorestown, NJ

### What are the emotions attached to this object for you?
- Everytime I look at the tattoo, it reminds me to love myself and others. Plus, knowing that the tattoo is above my heartbeat also reminds me that I'm alive and should appreciate what I have. It's literally my mantra turned into a physical form, so instead of going through my mantra in my head, I can just look at my wrist.

### Why did you choose it?
- I chose this to be my first tattoo because the <3 has so much meaning behind it for me, even if it seems like a basic Pinterest tattoo. It was the last thing I wrote to my math teacher/coach/friend/role model, it became my outro on all my YouTube videos, it became a pin, a shirt, and a sticker. and now it's evolved to become part of what I try to remind my audience: everything is <3.

### What do you see in your object that no one else would see?
- I see all the experiences I've gone through, both good and bad, that shape me to be the person I am today. I also see how much I've overcome thanks to this symbol, and how much it affects others positively around the world.

### Is it one of a kind?
- It's one of a kind because no one else has the same experiences with this symbol besides me, but I'm sure there's a million other people who have the same tattoo. Literally after I said I got this tattoo, a week later someone tweeted they got the same one because I got it.

### How do you interact with it?
- I look at it to remind myself to be happy, I moisturize it because otherwise it will flake, and I hid it from my family for a bit, but they actually liked it because all of them knew how much the <3 meant to me.

### What are some other objects it does or might have relationships with?
- my wrist? without my wrist there'd be no tattoo.

### What is a specific memory you have with this object?
- Besides the story and meaning behind it, I remember how much it hurt getting it. I thought I had a pretty good pain tolerance, but getting a tattoo felt like a knife slowly slicing through my hand. I feel bad every time I chop a fruit or vegetable now.
