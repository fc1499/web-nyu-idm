  <h1>Act 1: The Naming of Myself </h1>
    <div class="name-story">
      <h2>I was named after a Chinese phrase that means 'gift from Buddha.' I can't pronounce the phrase at all so I won't bother typing it. Turns out, I was an accident and my parents believed I was therefore a gift. hOW NiCe... ðŸ˜‘</h2>

      <h2>My middle name is Yuyao, which every kid from K-12 mispronounced. It means gem, precious, and rare all at the same time. (I think)</h2>

      <h2> My last name is Chen because every Chinese person's last name is Chen. </h2>
