      <p id="text1"> This was the high school I went to before moving to NJ. There was a math teacher who not only taught me Algebra, but she was also my coach, friend, and mentor. On the note I wrote for her, I said at the end, "If there's anything
        I learned in class, it's that everything is <3."</p>

      <img id="second_img" src="images/second.png">
      <p id="text2"> Moving day. During the whole road trip, all I could think about was the friends I‚Äôd be leaving behind and whether or not I‚Äôd be able to make new friends at a new school.</p>

      <img id="third_img" src="images/third.png">
      <p id="text3"> Over the summer, besides talking to my friends back home, I‚Äôd make YouTube videos as a hobby. A few weeks in, I decided to start saying ‚Äúeverything is <3‚Äù as my outro, and I‚Äôve said it ever since.</p>

      <img id="fourth_img" src="images/fourth.png">
      <p id="text4"> After two years of making videos, I reached 100,000 subscribers! I had a community on the internet, and they started to pick up on the meaning behind the phrase. It was nice to know I could spread some positivity online
            even though I wasn‚Äôt happy at home.</p>

      <img id="fifth_img" src="images/fifth_img">
      <p id="text5"> After working with a company for a few months, I was finally able to release merchandise for the first time. Of course one of the first designs I thought of was the phrase in my handwriting so people could have sometime
            more meaningful than weekly videos.</p>

      <img id="sixth_img" src="images/sixth_img">
      <p id="text6"> So this phrase all started between my math teacher and me. It became my mantra, then the outro to all my videos, and then merchandise. All that was left was for me to make sure I‚Äôd never forget how much the <3 symbol meant
            to me, so I got a tattoo of it on my arm.</p>
