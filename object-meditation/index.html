      <p class="text1">This is my old high school where I thought of the phrase "everything is less than 3." When I had to say goodbye to my math teacher/friend/coach, I wrote in a letter, "if there's anything I learned in your class, it's that everything is less than 3." </p>

      <button class="second">06.28.16</button>
      <!-- this was when I began moving from SC to NJ. During the road trip, I was upset at the thought of losing my old friends and having to go to a new school/city. but turning the phrase into my mantra helped ease the negativity. -->
